# Frontend Pages

Simple static pages for login, signup, and viewing the user profile. The pages use the backend API to authenticate users and store the JWT token in `localStorage`.

Serve these files from a static host or configure Express to serve them from the `/` path.

## Instructor Dashboard

`dashboard.html` provides a simple dashboard for instructors to manage their courses. It lists courses, recent activity, and allows creating or editing courses.
